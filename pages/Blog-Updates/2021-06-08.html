          <p>And that's all folks!</p>
          <p>
            I have just finished learning the majority of baseline HTML. I'm talking tags like p, a, input, form, image,
            table, section, aside, meta, ul, ol, ... all that good stuff. But in all seriousness, I believe I finished
            learning at least everything I will need HTML wise for right now. The syntax is relatively simple, emmet is
            a massive help, and in reality there is a lot you can do with only a few elements. I know I have only
            scratched the surface with respect to what is possible with HTML but for now, I think I am at a good point
            to move on to CSS. Once we get to the DOM stuff and manipulating elements, i'm sure a deeper dive will be
            necessary, but for now I'm good.
          </p>

            I think I waited so long to cover the basics of HTML because when you visit a site, there is this feeling
            that there is so much going on there. And not to say there isn't, I'm sure with respect to the scripting and
            styling implemented, there is considerable complexity. But not necessarily so in the HTML. It is only for
            structure. It is the noun that acts, not the action.
          </p>
          <p>Here's to learning some style and <b>finally</b> upgrading this site!</p>
