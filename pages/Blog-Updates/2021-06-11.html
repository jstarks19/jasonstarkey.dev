          <p>Welcome to the year 2021!!!</p>
          <p>
            Well ...maybe welcome to the year 2015. I tried my best with the color palette and design of the site, but I
            am not very familiar with modern design principles so if something seems a little off, it might be. I am not
            a master...yet!
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall though, I am very pleased with how the site looks for right now, and as I learn I will continue to
            improve it. I am really enjoying CSS, though it feels a little messy right now. Maybe after learning
            bootstrap/sass/tailwind the structure of it all will come together. I like the inheritance aspect of it as
            well, and the fact that you can use specifiers on selectors to grab very specific elements to style. I am
            thoroughly enjoying flexbox also. I learned CSS grid a few years back and it provided so much control that
            the idea of picking up flex seemed a bit useless. But now, as I have matured a bit, I realize why it is a
            useful tool and am getting some serious use out of it for this site! When <b>maximum control</b> is not
            necessary, it does a great job. Also, it helps with the lack of my understanding of responsive design,
            because in a way it is already responsive
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I am onto more CSS and hopefully the DOM soon. Also, canvas looks like a very cool element. I love art &
            animation, so as soon as I can start animating, look out for it here!
          </p>
          <p>If anybody is reading, thanks :)</p>
