          <p>Happy Monday!</p>
          <p>
            So it has been a little bit of time since my last post, just over a week. I was actually hoping to post this
            one by Friday night, but alas sometimes it works out a little differently than we imagine.
          </p>
          <p>
            On to the update. In the last week, I have made a concerted effort to relearn some of my fundamentals in
            JavaScript and to finally learn the DOM! The DOM is absolutley incredibly in my opinion. I had no idea that
            the underpinning of dynamic webpages was this object representation of HTML that is being manipulated behind
            the scenes. Adding functionality to a webpage is as simple as adding an Event Listener. Seeing the pieces
            fit together (JS, CSS, and HTML) really begins to get the gears turning.
          </p>
          <p>
            After becoming familiar with the DOM and some of it's core priniciples/methods, I implemented a small
            calculator. I included some animations, transitions, and transformations so as to get some more practice
            with them. I have also begun using <a href="https://coolers.com">Coolers.com</a> as a resource for my
            palettes! I usually can find nice color combinations, but it takes far too long. Coolers solves that issue,
            use it!
          </p>
          <p>Thanks for Listening, see ya next week!</p>
